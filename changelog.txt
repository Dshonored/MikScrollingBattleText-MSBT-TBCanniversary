Version 1.0.2

Version 1.0
-----------
Release Date: 2026

Changes:
--------
- Reduced spam control slider step increments for better TBC compatibility
  * Heal Threshold slider: Changed step increment from 100 to 50
  * Damage Threshold slider: Changed step increment from 100 to 50
  * Power Threshold slider: Changed step increment from 40 to 25
  
  These changes allow for finer control when setting spam thresholds, making it
  easier to configure appropriate values for The Burning Crusade servers where
  damage/healing values are typically much lower than retail.

Installation:
-------------
1. Extract both "MikScrollingBattleText" and "MSBTOptions" folders to your
   World of Warcraft/_anniversary_/Interface/AddOns/ directory
2. Restart World of Warcraft or type /reload in-game
3. Configure your spam control thresholds in the options menu

Notes:
------
- This version is optimized for TBC servers
- The spam control thresholds can now be adjusted in increments of 50 for
  heal/damage and 25 for power, allowing for more precise filtering
